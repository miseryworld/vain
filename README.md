// I don't know how to say this to you but I might as well now as I have nothing to lose. I've already lost everything. If you're reading this I might have already left or about to leave. I am broken inside. You may not have known this but you affected me deeply to a point where I lost myself in loving you. Yet you tortured me everyday. There was a time I saw my life with you, a future with you. But you shattered my dreams. I feel dead inside. I've never given so much of myself to someone or cared so much. You returned my love with lies. It didn't matter how many gifts I gave you or how beautiful I looked for you. you destroyed every bit of me, destroyed my soul. I can't eat or sleep or think or function. A love I thought would bring out the best in me. I don't know why destiny brought us together.<@miseryworld>
